# Ingredients
* 8 tbsp (1 stick) butter
* 1 cup sugar
* ¾ cup self-rising flour
* ¾ cup milk
* One can (28 oz) sliced peaches in syrup
# Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Put butter in deep baking dish and place in oven to melt.
3. Mix sugar and flour; add milk slowly to prevent lumping.
4. Pour over melted butter. Do not stir.
5. Spoon fruit on top, gently pouring in syrup. Still do not stir; batter will rise to top during baking.
6. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes. Good with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
## Variation:
When available, fresh fruit is wonderful. You may use fresh blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, cherries, apples, peaches, or pears. Simply clean, peel, and core 2 cups of fruit and mix with 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water. In a saucepan, bring mixture to a boil and then simmer for about 10 minutes. Stir often, making sure sugar is completely dissolved. Substitute this for the canned peaches.
