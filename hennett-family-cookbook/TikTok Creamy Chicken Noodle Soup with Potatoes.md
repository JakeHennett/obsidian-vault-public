# Directions
1. Cook the egg noodles in salted water according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.  2. In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breasts on both sides until golden, about 3-4 minutes per side, then remove them from the pot and set aside.  
2. Add the remaining olive oil and butter to the pot. Lower the heat to medium, then add the onion, celery, and carrot. Season with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes (if using), and sauté for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are softened.  
3. Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant. Pour in the wine, if using, stir and let simmer for 2 minutes.  
4. Pour in the chicken broth, season with salt and pepper.  6. Add the diced potatoes, chicken bouillon, Parmesan rind, and bay leaf. Stir to combine, then return the seared chicken breasts to the pot.  
5. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender.  
6. Remove the chicken breasts from the pot, shred them using two forks, and set aside.  
7. Check the potatoes to ensure they’re done, then remove the Parmesan rind and bay leaf.  
8. Stir in the heavy cream and lemon juice, followed by the parsley, dill, rosemary, and thyme.  
9. Return the shredded chicken to the pot, taste for seasoning, and adjust as needed.  
10. Serve the soup over the cooked egg noodles, topping each bowl with additional Parmesan, lemon juice, black pepper, red pepper flakes, dill, and a drizzle of olive oil. Enjoy!
